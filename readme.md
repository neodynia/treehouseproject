# How to complete this Code Adventure!

### The description and the function

Read the description at the top of the js file to understand how to 
complete this Code Adventure, and what type of function you're being 
asked to build. 

Below the description, a function will already be started for you.
Keep ALL your code inside this function. 

Note: To get the most out of this experience, you are encouraged to 
use the SIMPLEST, and not necessarily the shortest, syntax possible.
For example, use for loops instead of built-in methods like Array.reverse. 


### The output

Below the function, a few console.log statements have been included 
to print the output of the function. Feel free to change the input
of the function call here to help you debug. 


### The tests (DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE IN THE TESTS SECTION)

These if statements will "test" your function to let you know if 
your function meets all the criteria of a correct answer. 

When you're ready to test your function, you can use the console 
below the code editor. If the console is closed, you can open the 
it by selecting "show console" from the view menu above.

To run the tests, type the command below into the console and press 
enter.

    node maximum.js

The output will tell you which tests passed and which ones failed.
When all the tests pass, you have a working solution! Post it in 
the #code-adventures channels when it is appropriate to do so, and 
compare your solution with your fellow students to see how others 
approached this one!
